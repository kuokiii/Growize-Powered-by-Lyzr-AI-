**A tool I built to spark startup growth**

Welcome to the Growize Agent!  
Tired of endless brainstorming with no direction? I was too — until I built this tool to guide my side project with smart questions and actionable insights. It’s been a game changer, and I’m excited to share it.

## 🌿 About This Project

I once spent days wrestling with a startup idea, unsure where to pivot or how to decide. The Growize Agent was my answer — asking strategic questions, suggesting pivots, and offering frameworks, all in minutes. My week of testing taught me to clarify my goals, and I loved how it turned chaos into a clear plan.

- **Mission**: Empower startups with growth strategies  
- **Highlight**: No code, text-based simplicity  
- **My Take**: Saved me hours of guesswork

  _Example: “What’s your revenue source?”_

- **Pivot Suggestions**: Proposes smart shifts

## 🧪 My Testing Journey

I tested Growize with a mock e-commerce startup. I started with:

- **Input**: `Help my startup grow: Low traffic`  
- **Response**: “What’s your main product?”  
- **Pivot**: “Try social media ads”  
- **Framework**: “Test 30 days, track clicks”

Later, I entered:

- **Input**: `Sales flat`  
- **Response**: “Pivot: Add loyalty program”

I learned that **specificity matters** — vague entries like `Business struggling` led to prompts like:  
> “Please specify your industry.”

That made the tool feel smart, and it **cut my planning time by hours**.

- **Lesson**: Clear inputs yield better insights  
- **Win**: Gave me a solid growth roadmap
